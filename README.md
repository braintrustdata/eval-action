# Braintrust eval action

This project enables you to run [Braintrust evals](braintrust.dev) as part of
your CI/CD workflow in Github, using
[Github actions](https://github.com/features/actions). To use this action,
simply include the following step in an action file:

```yaml
- name: Run Evals
  uses: braintrustdata/eval-action@v1
  with:
    api_key: ${{ secrets.BRAINTRUST_API_KEY }}
    runtime: node
```

You can configure the following variables:

- `api_key`: Your
  [Braintrust API key](https://www.braintrust.dev/app/settings/api-keys).
- `root`: The root directory containing your evals (defaults to `'.'`). The root
  directory must either have `node` or `python` configured.
- `paths`: Specific paths, relative to the root, containing evals you'd like to
  run.
- `runtime`: Either `node` or `python`
- `use_proxy`: Either `true` or `false`. If set, `OPENAI_BASE_URL` will be set
  to `https://braintrustproxy.com/v1`, which will automatically cache repetitive
  LLM calls and run your evals faster. Defaults to `true`.

## Full example

```yaml
name: Run pnpm evals

on:
  push:
    # Uncomment to run only when files in the 'evals' directory change
    # - paths:
    #     - "evals/**"

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  eval:
    name: Run evals
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        id: checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Node.js
        id: setup-node
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20

      - uses: pnpm/action-setup@v3
        with:
          version: 8

      - name: Install Dependencies
        id: install
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Run Evals
        uses: braintrustdata/eval-action@v1
        with:
          api_key: ${{ secrets.BRAINTRUST_API_KEY }}
          runtime: node
          root: my_eval_dir
```

- [`node with pnpm`](examples/pnpm.yml)
- [`python`](examples/python.yml)

## How it works

The action runs `braintrust eval` and collects experiment results, which are
posted as a comment in the PR alongside a link to Braintrust. For example:
